    letterMessage: `Special delivery, straight from me to you. My dearest love,

Every moment with you feels like a beautiful dream that I never want to wake up from.

My Love,

If I had to choose a moment where loving you began,
I wouldn’t point to a first glance or a first word.
It began quietly in the way my heart learned your name before my lips ever said it.

Loving you feels like standing on the edge of something infinite.
Like Jack holding Rose’s hand and saying “You jump, I jump.”
Like loving without knowing how the story ends
but choosing it anyway.

You are not a chapter in my life.
You are the spine that holds it together.

There is a softness in you that disarms me.
A strength that doesn’t ask to be admired, yet commands devotion.
When you look at me, I feel seen not judged, not measured —
just understood, the way lovers in old stories are understood,
before the world taught them fear.

If loving you is a kind of madness,
then let it be the beautiful kind 
the kind Dracula would choose eternity for,
the kind Damon Salvatore would burn the world for,
the kind where love is not safe, but sacred.

I would find you in every lifetime.
In corsets and candlelight,
in war-torn letters stained with ink and longing,
in ballrooms where hands brush and the whole world pauses,
in storms where someone whispers “Take my hand”
and the darkness loses its power.

You don’t just make my heart race 
you make it stay.

I love you in the quiet ways most.
In the pauses between words.
In the way my soul exhales when you’re near.
In the certainty that even if the world collapses,
loving you would still feel like home.

I am not promising perfection.
I am promising presence.
To stand with you when love is gentle
and when it is heavy.
To choose you not only when it’s romantic,
but when it is real.

Some loves are written in stars.
Some are sealed in fate.
Ours feels written in courage —
the courage to feel deeply,
to stay vulnerable,
to love without armor.

If this life is brief,
then let me spend it loving you fiercely.
If there are more lives after this,
I will find you again
and fall just as hard.

So take my hand —
not just when the music swells,
but when it fades.
Not just in the light,
but in every shadow.

I am yours.
Not loudly.
Not carelessly.
But completely.

Always.

      "You're the calm I reach for and the laugh that brightens my day.",
      "I have loved you in silence and in storm, in moments where words failed me and in moments where my heart spoke too loudly for my mouth to follow. If this were a story, it would not begin with fireworks. It would begin with a glance held a second too long. With a hand almost touching. With something unspoken that changed everything. You did not arrive like a moment. You arrived like a turning point. There are loves that are gentle and easy. There are loves that are fierce and reckless. And then there is this — the kind of love that teaches you patience, that asks you to stay, that asks you to feel deeply without guarantees. I think of the way letters were once written — ink trembling on paper, hope folded into envelopes, love sent into the unknown with nothing but faith. This is one of those letters. I would find you in every lifetime. On a ship bound for disaster, in a ballroom where the world pauses between breaths, in a war where love survives only in memory, in the dark where someone reaches out and whispers, “Take my hand.” And I would take it. Every time. You have undone me in the quietest ways. In the way you stay. In the way you feel. In the way you exist without asking to be chosen — and yet you are. If loving you means vulnerability, then let me be bare. If it means waiting, then let me wait. If it means choosing you even when the ending is unclear, then let this be my choice. I am not promising perfection. I am promising devotion. The kind that does not fade when the music stops. The kind that does not run when the night grows long. The kind that says, “Even here. Even now. Still you.” Some loves are written in fate. Some are written in sacrifice. Ours feels written in courage — the courage to feel everything, to risk everything, to love without armor. If this world is kind, we will have time. If it is not, then let this letter stand as proof that once, someone loved you with their whole soul and never regretted it. So take my hand — not only in joy, but in darkness. Not only in certainty, but in faith. I am yours. Not briefly. Not lightly. But completely. Always."
